# Astyanax-Inspired C++ Game

Welcome to my simple C++ game project replicating the classic game [**Astyanax**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Astyanax)! This project was developed during my second semester of school as part of a programming assignment. It was a great opportunity to practice and improve my C++ skills, especially in encapsulation and basic game development concepts. While the game is not a perfect replica of Astyanax, it incorporates many of its core mechanics with some simplifications and changes to make it easier to implement and play.

## Overview
This project is a 2D side-scrolling action game where the player controls a hero who must defeat enemies and clear a level. The game was built using a simple C++ game engine provided by my teacher. It features basic gameplay mechanics such as movement, attacking, power-ups, and enemy interactions. The game is not polished or optimized for professional standards, but it served as a valuable learning experience in game development and C++ programming.

## Features
- **Single Level Gameplay**: The game consists of one level. Upon dying, the level resets. Upon winning, an image is displayed indicating the first round has been cleared, after which the level resets.
- **Enemy System**: Enemies can drop random pick-ups when defeated. The boss is a stronger version of the Skeleton enemy with a different-colored skin.
- **Power-Ups and Weapon Upgrades**: Players can collect power-ups dropped by enemies and weapon upgrades dropped by pillars.
- **SP Regeneration**: Special Points (SP) regenerate over time, allowing players to use power-ups more frequently.
- **Simplified Memory Management**: Enemy instances are not freed and reallocated upon respawning. Instead, their positions and stats are reset, and they are reactivated after certain conditions are met.
- **Attacking While Moving**: Players can attack while crouching or jumping.

## Conclusion
This project was a lot of fun to work on and figure out over the course of the semester. Looking back on it 3 years later, having acquired more knowledge and experience on the matter of making games, there are definitely a lot of things to improve on. It's not the best code I wrote, but it served it's purpose in my learning journey. That being said, I will not be working any more than I already have on this project. 

Thank you for checking out my project! Feel free to explore the code, play the game, and provide feedback. This was a great learning experience, and I hope to continue improving my skills in game development and programming. Enjoy! üéÆ
