# Astyanax-Inspired C++ Game

Welcome to my simple C++ game project inspired by the classic game [**Astyanax**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Astyanax)! This project was developed during my second semester of school as part of a programming assignment. It was a great opportunity to practice and improve my C++ skills, especially in encapsulation and basic game development concepts. While the game is not a perfect replica of Astyanax, it incorporates many of its core mechanics with some simplifications and changes to make it easier to implement and play.

## Overview
This project is a 2D side-scrolling action game where the player controls a hero who must defeat enemies and clear a level. The game was built using a simple C++ game engine provided by my teacher. It features basic gameplay mechanics such as movement, attacking, power-ups, and enemy interactions. The game is not polished or optimized for professional standards, but it served as a valuable learning experience in game development and C++ programming.

## Features
- **Single Level Gameplay**: The game consists of one level. Upon dying, the level resets. Upon winning, an image is displayed indicating the first round has been cleared, after which the level resets.
- **Enemy System**: Enemies can drop random pick-ups when defeated. The boss is a stronger version of the Skeleton enemy with a different-colored skin.
- **Power-Ups and Weapon Upgrades**: Players can collect power-ups dropped by enemies and weapon upgrades dropped by pillars.
- **SP Regeneration**: Special Points (SP) regenerate over time, allowing players to use power-ups more frequently.
- **Simplified Memory Management**: Enemy instances are not freed and reallocated upon respawning. Instead, their positions and stats are reset, and they are reactivated after certain conditions are met.
- **Attacking While Moving**: Players can attack while crouching or jumping.

## Controls
- **Left Arrow**: Move left
- **Right Arrow**: Move right
- **Up Arrow**: Jump
- **Down Arrow**: Crouch
- **Z Key**: Normal attack
- **X Key**: Use power-up
- **Left Shift Key**: Switch between power-ups
- **Esc Key**: Pause the game

## Differences from the Original Game
- Only one level is available.
- The boss is replaced with a stronger version of the Skeleton enemy.
- SP regenerates over time.
- Enemies drop random pick-ups when killed.
- Pillars always drop weapon upgrades.
- Simplified enemy respawning system (no memory reallocation).

## Technical Details
- **Language**: C++
- **Game Engine**: A simple C++ game engine provided by my teacher.
- **Graphics**: Original Astyanax sprites were used.
- **Collision Detection**: A `.svg` file was used for level collision.
- **Memory Management**: Enemy instances are reused by resetting their positions and stats instead of reallocating memory.
